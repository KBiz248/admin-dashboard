QUESTIONS ABOUT SEMANTICS
    Should the divs that contain text (titles/descriptions on cards and announcements) be <p> tags instead?
    Was it appropriate to use <h> tags on "Dashboard", "Your Projects", "Announcements", and "Trending"?
    Should <h> tags have been used on all of the project titles?
    (for all of the above questions about semantics) Why or why not?

RANDOM QUESTION
    Looking at div.line:
        Would it have been appropriate to use <hr> tags instead?
        Speaking of <hr> tags: the lines they created went from horizontal to vertical when div#announcement-card was was set to grid. Why is that?

    Using javascript to add style seemed to create a bit of a lag whe the page was reloaded.
        Does the use of javascript in this way affect load speed?

QUESTION ABOUT LINKS
    The links on the third card (image credits for Edward Elric) do not work when the page is maximized.
    When the window is resized and the cards are only in one column, then the links work just fine.
    Why don't they just work all of the time?
    What is going on here?

MISTAKES WERE MADE AND LESSONS WERE LEARNED
    I encounted a problem involving line 164 of style.css that stumped me for a while.
    I figured it out, and the explanation is written on lines 168-177.
    Other lines of code involved are line 94 and lines 138-143.
    Feel free to read and learn from my mistakes.
